Data Collection

Sources 
- Internet -> Open Source Website / Scraping / API Calls
  - API Calls -> Weather, News, Cricket Score, Stock Market
- Files
  - Structured - CSV, Excel
  - Semi-Structured - JSON, XML
  - Unstructured - Raw Text, PDF, Word Document
- Database
  - Structured - SQL
  - Semi-Structured - Mongo DB


Requirement
- Build a sentiment analysis system
  - classify product reviews into positive or negative

End Goal - Implement Machine Learning to classify reviews

1. Scrap the Data

Pre-requisite to perform Scraping
- HTML

1. Hit the URL from where you want to scrap the data
  - use package - urllib.request

2. We need a package - BeautifulSoup (third-party)
  -> pip install bs4
  what is pip ?
   - package manager for Python



API - Application Programming Interface

JSON - Javascript Object Notation

{key : value} - In python it's a dictionary

[] - list
() - tuples
{} - dictionary


Streamlit - 
library for making web applications using Python

pip install streamlit

CUI - Console User Interface
GUI - Graphical User Interface
	- Mobile App
	- Web App
	- Desktop App


Data Types
- Numeric
  - int
  - float
  - complex
- Bytes
  - bytes
- Boolean
  - True
  - False
- Data Collection
  - String
  - List
  - Tuples
  - Dictionary
  - Set


String
- collection of characters, letters, words, symbols
- represented by "hello", 'hello', """hello""", '''hello'''
- strings are immutable (cannot be modified)
- internally strings are character array


Indexing
Slicing
Methods


- List
  - collection of any type of data
  - represented by [...]

  - to store data in a list : append, extend, insert
  - to remove data from list : pop, remove

  - List Comprehension

- Tuple
  - similar to list, but immutable
  - represented by ()

- Dictionary
  - Collection of data in key and value pair
  - data can be retrieved through keys only, it means indexing is not supported


- Set

[] -> list
() -> tuples
{key:value} -> dictionary 
{} -> set


{key : value}
- javascript object
- python dictionary
- JSON
- Java Hashmap


DRY - Donot Repeat Yourself

Refactoring
- Change code without changing functionality


1. When a new employee is added:
  - add employee joining date - pick current date of laptop
2. Implement delete and update functions
