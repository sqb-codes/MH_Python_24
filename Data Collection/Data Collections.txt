Data Collections
- String

  - methods

- List
  - collection of any type of data
  - represented by [...]

  - to store data in a list : append, extend, insert

  - List Comprehension

- Tuple
  - similar to list, but immutable
  - represented by ()

- Dictionary
  - Collection of data in key and value pair
  - data can be retrieved through keys only, it means indexing is not supported

[] -> list
() -> tuples
{key:value} -> dictionary 
{} -> set


{key : value}
- javascript object
- python dictionary
